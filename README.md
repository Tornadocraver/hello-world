# hello-world
My first (test) repository

Hello, Tornadocraver here. I like programming a lot in the .NET framework, as well
as turning ideas into products. I hope to upload a lot of my code projects here as
a reference from my tutorial series on YouTube (Tornadohackerz). I will accept any
tutorial requests made her (GitHub) or on my YouTube channel.

If you have any questions/requests, my email is: micahmail9@gmail.com
